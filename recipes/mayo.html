        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Mayonnaise is an emulsion of oil and water—two liquids that generally don't get along. Look at it under a microscope and you'll see it's made up of teeny-tiny fat droplets coated in a thin film of emulsifying agents (mainly in the form of lecithin, a protein found in egg yolks, and mucilage, a slimy substance found in mustard and other plants), separated by water. Emulsifiers are unique in that one end of them is attracted to fats, while the other is attracted to water. When they bury their fat-loving heads into the minuscule droplets of oil, their water-loving tails are exposed, allowing the fat and the water to coexist peacefully.</p>
        <p>Because you are attempting to combine two ingredients that really don't want to be combined, mayonnaise is notoriously difficult to make. Classic technique will have you start by whisking egg yolks, a bit of mustard, a few drops of water, and some acid (either lemon juice or vinegar), then slowly, slowly, slowly trickling in a thin stream of oil as you continue to beat rapidly. The idea is to get the oil to disperse itself into tiny droplets as you whisk it. Pour the oil too fast and you end up with a broken, greasy, curdled-looking mess instead of the smooth, rich, creamy sauce of your dreams. About half the time I try to make mayonnaise with this method, it breaks, and I'm forced to start over.</p>
        <p>There are a number of techniques for making this process a bit more foolproof, with the blender or the food processor being the usual go-to—the high-speed whirring blades make short work of dispersing oil droplets. The problem with either of these appliances, however, is that you need to make a fairly large amount of mayo for them to work—start with a single egg yolk, for example, and there's not enough volume in there to spin around properly. The egg flies up and splats against the walls, leaving you nothing to work with at the bottom of the jar/bowl.</p>
        <p>They also still require you to drizzle in your oil ever so slowly. A blender or food processor gets me up to about 85% success.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul type="circle">
            <li>egg 1nos</li>
            <li>lemon juice 15ml (from half a lemon)</li>
            <li>dijon mustard 1tsp</li>
            <li>garlic clove 1nos</li>
            <li>canola/vegetable oil 1cuo(240ml)</li>
            <li>kosher salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Place egg, lemon juice, and mustard in the bottom of cup or jar that just fits the head of your immersion blender. The egg/lemon juice mixture must reach the blades for this to work (see note). If the mixture does not reach the blades, double the recipe before attempting.</li>
            <li>Add garlic, if using. Pour oil on top and allow to settle for 15 seconds. Place head of immersion blender at bottom of cup and turn it on high speed. Do not pulse or move the head. As mayonnaise forms, slowly tilt and lift the head of the immersion blender until all oil is emulsified. Season mayonnaise to taste with salt. Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks.</li>
        </ol>
